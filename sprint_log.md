# Snip – Sprint Log (Hourly Progress)

Use this file to log what you do every hour (or every session). One place to see your progress and stay un-lost.

**How to use:** Add a new row each time you work. Date, what you did, and which phase it maps to. No need to be formal — bullet points are fine.

## Log format

Copy the block below when you add a new entry:

```
### YYYY-MM-DD – HH:00 (or "Morning" / "Afternoon")
- **Phase:** [Shell / Brain / Product / Launch]
- **Done:** [What you did in plain English]
